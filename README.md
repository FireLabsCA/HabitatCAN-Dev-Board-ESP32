# HabitatCAN Dev Board (ESP32)

A development board designed for HabitatCAN home automation applications, featuring an ESP32-C3-MINI-1 microcontroller with integrated CAN bus transceiver and comprehensive I/O capabilities.

## Overview

The HabitatCAN Dev Board is a development platform for building HabitatCAN-compatible devices. HabitatCAN is an open standard for home automation built on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, providing reliable, low-latency communication between sensors, switches, actuators, and controllers in residential and light commercial environments.

Unlike proprietary systems (Control4, KNX, Zigbee), HabitatCAN is designed to be open, inexpensive, and implementable on common microcontrollers. It leverages structured cabling (Ethernet Cat5e/Cat6) for wiring but uses CAN signaling rather than Ethernet, allowing for robust operation in electrically noisy environments and over long distances.

## What is HabitatCAN?

HabitatCAN is a local-first home automation standard that provides:

- **Reliable Communication**: CAN bus ensures robust, real-time communication over structured cabling
- **Local-First Design**: Homes continue to function without Internet or cloud connectivity
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures are isolated and recovered automatically
- **Simple Devices**: Minimal logic in devices, complexity handled by controllers
- **Extensibility**: New device types and commands can be added without breaking older firmware

### Key Features of HabitatCAN:
- **500 kbit/s CAN bus** over Cat5e/Cat6 cabling (~100m reach)
- **24V courtesy power** distributed over structured cabling
- **Hierarchical addressing**: NetworkID (16-bit) + RoomID (8-bit) + NodeID (8-bit)
- **Automatic device discovery** and commissioning
- **Group and scene support** for complex automation
- **Fault tolerance** with backup controllers and local autonomy
